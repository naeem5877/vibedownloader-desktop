### 🐛 Critical Fixes
- **Smart File Naming (Instagram/Social)**: Fixed a major issue where multiple videos from the same creator (Instagram/Facebook/TikTok) would overwrite each other. Files are now saved with a unique identifier (e.g., `Username_VideoID.mp4`) while keeping the clean username display in notifications.
- **CI/CD Pipeline Repair**: Resolved a Spotify environment variable injection failure in GitHub Actions by switching to a robust, cross-platform Node.js script for `.env` generation.
