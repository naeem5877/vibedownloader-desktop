## 📥 Download & Installation

### 🪟 Windows
1. Download the `.exe` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/naeem5877/vibedownloader-desktop/releases/latest)
2. Run the installer

---

### 🍎 macOS

1. Download the `.dmg` from the [Releases page](https://github.com/naeem5877/vibedownloader-desktop/releases/latest)

#### macOS Security Notice (Important)

macOS may show **“VibeDownloader is damaged and can’t be opened”**.  
This happens because the app is not signed with an Apple Developer ID yet.

**Fix (one-time command):**

```bash
xattr -c /Applications/VibeDownloader.app
Then open the app normally.

This only removes macOS quarantine flags.
The app is fully open source — anyone can inspect the code before running it.
